libinput
--------

This package provides a pure python wrapper for *libinput*, a library that
handles input devices for display servers and other applications that need to
directly deal with input devices.It provides device detection, device handling,
input device event processing and abstraction.

*libinput* does this by reading character files in ``/dev/input/``, so to use
this package you need to run your code as root or to belong to ``input`` group.
